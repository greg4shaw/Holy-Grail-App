# Holy Grail App Project
> MIT xPRO - Week 25

This project was part of the course work required in the MIT xPRO Full-Stack development course taken.

## Description

A basic project to design a full-stack application that renders a 'Holy Grail' front end layout.

### Features

* Full front end Holy Grail Layout
* Linkages from the Browser Client through the HTTP server to the Data Store
* Packages used:
- React
- SuperAgent
- Express
- Node.js
- Docker
- Redis

## Installation

Clone the files that are in the Holy Grail App directory to your local machine.
To do this complete the following steps:
- run `npm install` in the root folder in order to install all dependencies
- start your Docker daemon
- run the main index file by running `node index.js`
- Once is it running, you can open your browser and navigate to the following site:
    - http://localhost:3000   
- To quit the application you can use `Ctrl + c`

## Support

If by some unexpected circumstance the data stops rendering, please get hold of me at gman.international@gmail.com and I will make it all right again.
